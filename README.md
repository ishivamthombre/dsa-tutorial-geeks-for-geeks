# 📘 DSA Tutorial

**Last Updated:** 25 Dec, 2025

DSA stands for **Data Structures and Algorithms**.  
Data Structures manage how data is stored and accessed, while Algorithms focus on processing this data.

**Examples:**
- **Data Structures:** Array, Linked List, Tree, Heap
- **Algorithms:** Binary Search, Quick Sort, Merge Sort

---

## 🚀 Why Learn DSA?

- Foundation for almost every software such as **GPS, Search Engines, AI Chatbots, Gaming Apps, Databases, Web Applications**, etc.
- **Top companies** like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and many others heavily focus on DSA in interviews.
- Learning DSA boosts **problem-solving skills** and makes you a stronger programmer.
