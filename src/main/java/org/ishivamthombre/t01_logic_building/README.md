## 🎯 Tips to Improve Programming Logic

- **Understand the problem**  
  Carefully read and understand the problem statement.

- **Generate examples**  
  Create your own input and output test cases.

- **Draw observations**  
  Identify patterns and insights from the examples.

- **Start with basics**  
  First solve the problem in a simple way, then optimize it.
